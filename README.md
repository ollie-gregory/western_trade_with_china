# UK, US and EU complicity in Chinese Carbon Emissions

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to investigate the extent to which the UK, US and EU are complicit in Chinese carbon emissions from manufacturing. China is a major global manufacturer and responsible for a lot of the world's carbon emissions. However, a significant proportion of these emissions are due to the production of goods for export to other countries. This project will investigate the extent to which the UK, US and EU are complicit in these emissions by importing goods from China.

## To do:

- [ ] Gather data on carbon emissions from manufacturing in China.
- [ ] Gather data on imports of goods from China by the UK, US and EU.
    - [ ] Gather data on the carbon intensity of different goods.
- [ ] Calculate the carbon emissions embodied in imports from China by the UK, US and EU.
- [ ] Compare these emissions to the total emissions of the UK, US and EU.
- [ ] Gather data on investment in renewable energy in China, the UK, US and EU.
- [ ] Collate results into a report.
